this directory is required for the hacky ass root cause proof in the pudding solution described below
remove this directory once the tornadow prediction model server issue has been resolved


Pushing a version of admin-private and api-private that successfully post a Uint8Array-arrayBuffer binary payload from our Vue.js Admin UI to a G.S.D. version of the  tensorflow/mnist-rawer model that is imported locally inside our api-private Flask API so I could prove without a doubt it is a Tornado Web Server setting that is preventing us from posting binary payloads to our Tornado prediction model server.
I thought I was going to go even more RAW => rawER but realized you can not, but I did fix some bugs that were causing the mnist-raw model to fail.
