# Observed Behavior:  
#   If PS dies, Master needs restart.
#   If Master dies, training continues (however no checkpoint hooks or PS health checks are being performed)
#   If 1 Worker dies, training continues on remaining Worker(s).
#   If Worker is restarted, Training continues on the Worker.
#   All PS, Master, and Worker must be started before training starts.
